# Noisy_Data_Generation_Project

### Project Overview 
This project focuses on the creation, manipulation, and analysis of a custom, noisy dataset using Python. The primary objectives are to deepen the understanding of the impact of noise in datasets, enhance Python programming skills, and compile comprehensive project documentation. This repository is a valuable resource for anyone looking to explore the challenges of working with noisy data in Python. It is especially useful for students, data scientists, and researchers interested in understanding the impact of data quality on analysis and machine learning models.

### Introduction

This file contains code to generate a synthetic dataset simulating a store's purchasing information. Follow these steps to reproduce the project on your local machine.

### Prerequisites
> Python installed </br>
> Virtualenv installed </br>

### Steps to Reproduce

1. Create a Virtual Environment:
* Open your terminal.
* Navigate to the project directory.
* Run the following commands:

``` bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows Powershell, use 'venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1'
```

2. Install Dependencies
* Install the required libraries by running:

``` bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the Jupyter Notebook called dataset_generation.ipynb

4. Notebook Sections and Outline </br>
The notebook is divided into sections which consist of: 
* Import Libraries
* Faker Seed and Global Variables
* Table Creation
* Identify subgroups/classes per table (if applicable)
* Table Noise Insertion
* Final Dataset Creation
* Additional Noise Insertion
* Export results of all tables and final dataset to excel
